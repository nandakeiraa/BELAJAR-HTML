        <p>How it Works
            Step 1. Course enrollment
            Enroll by paying the enrollment fee and gain access to the course and final exam. There is no deadline to take the exam. All questions in the exam are based on W3Schools content.
            <br>
            Step 2. Complete the course learning modules
            The courses are self-paced with text based modules, practical interactive examples and exercises to check your understanding as you progress. Complete the learning modules to unlock the final exam.
            <br>
            Step 3. Take the exams
            The exams are taken at the end of each course after finishing the course learning modules. Immediately after completing the exam, you will be informed of your score and of your pass/fail status. You will get three attempts to pass each exam. You can use the new attempts to improve your score. The best result of the attempts will count.
            <br>
            Step 4: Become certified
            Pass the exams and get your certifications and your Certified Developer titles! Each certificate gets a unique link that can be shared with others. Validate your certificates with a link or a QR code.</p>
